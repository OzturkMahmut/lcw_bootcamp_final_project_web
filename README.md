# LCW BOOTCAMP FINAL PROJECT WEB

Test cases for the given scenario is completed for the web version using the architecture discussed in lectures.
Seperate feature and java class files are created for each page. Then for the end-to-end testing, in feature file called 
cartPage, full scenario can be found. However, it does not include sign up or login cases. The reason for that is, the IP
is blocked for login after some testing even when the option to block automation detection is used.
Nevertheless, all steps of the scenario including sign-up and login cases can be found in their own feature files.
